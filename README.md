Shave My Back
Shave My Back is a satisfyingly visceral, web-based simulation game where players take on the role of a meticulous (or clumsy) groomer. The game features a unique multi-layer hair system that requires precision and patience to clear.

Key Features
Progressive Shaving Mechanics: Experience a realistic grooming progression as you shave through four distinct stages of hair: long, medium, short, and stubble.

Fluid & Natural Feel: Built with custom line-drawing logic to ensure every stroke of the razor is smooth and responsive, avoiding the "patchy" look of standard drawing apps.

Consequence System: Shave too aggressively in one spot, and you'll cause realistic wounds to appear on the skin.

Full Action History: Includes a robust Undo/Redo system and a quick Restart button, allowing you to perfect your technique.

Custom Assets: Features hand-drawn assets for various hair densities, razor models, and a detailed skin backdrop.

Technical Details
Engine: Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

Rendering: Utilizes multiple stacked canvases with destination-out composite operations to simulate hair removal in real-time.

State Management: Implements a snapshot-based history stack to track hair removal and wound placement for undo/redo functionality.
